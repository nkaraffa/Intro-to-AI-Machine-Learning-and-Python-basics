## Knowledge

### Vocab:
	• Heuristics:
		○ a rule that works in many cases, but not in all. Enables you to quickly make a decision when there is no way or time for a detailed analysis of the situation.
	• Deep Learning:
		○ use of neural networks in machine learning.
	• Neural networks:
		○ algorithms which imitate the logic of the human brain.
	• Supervised Learning:
		○ model is trained on labeled data (prepared data).
	• Unsupervised Learning:
		○ model is trained on unlabeled data (algorithm makes decisions based on data attributes).
	• Regression:
		○ determining a predicated numerical value based on a given data set. Values generally follow a trend (e.g. linear or exponential regression).
	• Classification:
		○ segmenting data based on features that could predict a specific outcome (e.g. likely versus unlikely to default on a bank loan based on data patterns).
	• Clustering:
		○ a method of understanding data sets by placing data with similar attributes into similar groups or "clusters."
	• Ensemble Methods:
		○ Combines different algorithms to make a data model more accurate
	• Bagging:
		○ Breakdown data set into smaller randomly generated data sets that can be more easily analyzed, then aggregate the results. (Parallel Training Method)
	• Boosting:
		○ First algorithm is trained on the data set. Every subsequent algorithm is modified to correct the previous versions mistakes. (Sequential Training Method)
	• Random Forest:
		○ Create data subsets, use different features for every set, then analyze and aggregate the results (similar to Bagging)
	• Epoch:
		○ Pass / Train the entire dataset through the neural network once

### Explanations:
	• AI -> ML -> Deep Learning
	
	• Neural Network:  Input Layer -> Hidden Layer -> Output Layer
		o Hidden layer nodes have different weights that help determine output
